# 🚀 Colab Video Shrink (H.264/H.265)

An efficient, GPU-accelerated video transcoding script designed to run on **Google Colab**. This tool helps users with limited data plans (like 1GB monthly limits) convert large video files into highly optimized, mobile-friendly versions without losing clarity.

## ✨ Features
- **GPU Accelerated**: Uses NVIDIA NVENC for lightning-fast encoding.
- **Codec Toggle**: Switch between **H.264 (AVC)** for compatibility and **H.265 (HEVC)** for maximum data saving.
- **Google Drive Integration**: Automatically saves finished files to your Drive to prevent data loss.
- **Batch Processing**: Queue multiple episodes and walk away while the script handles the rest.
- **Smart Bitrate**: Automatically adjusts bitrates based on your codec choice to maintain a ~75MB target.

## 🛠️ Usage
1. Open this script in **Google Colab**.
2. Change the Runtime type to **T4 GPU** (`Runtime > Change runtime type`).
3. Set your `CODEC_CHOICE` ("H264" or "H265").
4. Add your video URLs to the `episodes` dictionary.
5. Run the cells and check your Google Drive!

## 📊 Why H.265?
H.265 (HEVC) provides roughly 30-50% better compression than H.264. This allows you to watch the same content with better quality while using significantly less of your data plan.
